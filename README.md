This is my first nsmb rom hack! This rom hack, known as New Super Mario Bros. Refresh, is in the middle of sorta sequel and tweaked NSMB, it will have all 8 worlds from NSMB but all levels will be tweaked to feel new. 
This rom hack will be made using NSMBe 5.4.1. You can find and download at www.nsmbhd.com.
